Author's description:

Phosphorus Green 3D animated cursor set. Spinning side mnemonics on pointers and animated raster scan line. Based on improved techniques I learned making Cyberpunk Blue set. Created with RealWorld Cursor Editor, CorelDRAW, POV-Ray, and custom in-house software. Outlined so more viewable on light surfaces, but designed to be used against dark backgrounds.

Updated: Models, Textures, Transforms.
